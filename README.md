# Description

This is a test project to setup an HTTP service, where a docker image is built and pushed to registry. There are 3 endpoints in the service, which will be available on localhost:8080 when running. A testfile has also been added, along with the Dockerfile to build the image and makefile to run the docker build and run commands.
